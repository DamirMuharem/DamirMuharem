### Hey!

I’m a Game Developer and a hardworking and passionate programmer who loves to play and make video games.
For past years I worked on a lot of project, some with team, some by myself. Unity is main engine that I used but I also have experience with Unreal Engine. I created all sort of games in both 2D and 3D that got published on PC and mobile. I’m comfortable writing in C# and C++.
I took a part in few Game Jams where I got a lot of experience working with other people.
